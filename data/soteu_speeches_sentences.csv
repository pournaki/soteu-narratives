1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"As stated at the euro area Summit on 21 July: ""We are determined to continue to provide support to countries under programmes until they have regained market access, provided they successfully implement those programmes.""",1_55
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,That is why I created the Task Force for Greece.,1_56
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"We have just launched an action plan based on two major pillars:

    Around 100 viable and high-quality projects, investing in all Greek regions, to make the best use of Greece's remaining allocation of the structural funds.",1_57
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,And a major drive to reduce bureaucratic procedures for European co-funded projects.,1_58
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,€ 15 billion remain to be spent in Greece from the structural funds.,1_59
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,This will support the Greek economy with an urgent programme of technical assistance to the Greek administration.,1_60
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,A programme of € 500 million Euros to guarantee European Investment Bank loans to Greek SMEs is already under way.,1_61
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,The Commission is also considering a wider guarantee mechanism to help banks lend again to the real economy.,1_62
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,All of this represents a huge support to Greece's fight back and Greece will have to deliver concrete results.,1_63
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,It must break with counter productive practices and resist vested interests.,1_64
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,But we have to be clear about this.,1_65
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"This is not a sprint, but a marathon.",1_66
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,The task of building a Union of stability and responsibility is not only about Greece.,1_67
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,The economic outlook that we face is very difficult.,1_68
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,We are confronted with the negative effects of an ongoing global re-assessment of risks.,1_69
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,It is therefore our responsibility to rebuild confidence and trust in the euro and our Union as a whole.,1_70
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"And we can do this by showing that we are able to take all the decisions needed to run a common currency and an integrated economy in a competitive, inclusive and resource-efficient way.",1_71
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"For this we need to act in the short, in the medium and the long term.",1_72
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,The first step is to quickly fix the way we respond to the sovereign debt crisis.,1_73
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,This will require stronger mechanisms for crisis resolution.,1_74
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,We need credible firepower and effective firewalls for the euro.,1_75
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,We have to build on the EFSF and the upcoming European Stability Mechanism.,1_76
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,The EFSF must immediately be made both stronger and more flexible.,1_77
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,This is what the Commission proposed already in January.,1_78
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,This is what Heads of State and Government of the euro area agreed upon on 21 July.,1_79
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"Only then, when you ratify this, will the EFSF be able to:

    deploy precautionary intervention;

    intervene to support the recapitalisation of banks,

    intervene in the secondary markets to help avoid contagion 

Once the EFSF is ratified, we should make the most efficient use of its financial envelope.",1_80
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,The Commission is working on options to this end.,1_81
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,Moreover we should do everything possible to accelerate the entry into force of the ESM.,1_82
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,And naturally we trust that the European Central Bank – in full respect of the Treaty – will do whatever is necessary to ensure the integrity of the euro area and to ensure its financial stability.,1_83
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,But we cannot stop there.,1_84
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"We must deepen economic coordination and integration, particularly in the euro area.",1_85
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,This is at least as big a political task as an economic one.,1_86
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"Today, you will vote on the so-called ""six-pack"" proposals that we put in front of you and the Council one year ago.",1_87
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"This ""six-pack"" reforms the Stability and Growth Pact and widens surveillance to macro-economic imbalances.",1_88
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,We are now back very close to what the Commission originally put on the table.,1_89
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"You have played a decisive role in keeping the level of ambition of these proposals, and I really want to thank you and congratulate you for that.",1_90
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,This legislation will give us much stronger enforcement mechanisms.,1_91
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,We can now discuss Member States' budgetary plans before national decisions are taken.,1_92
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,This mix of discipline and integration holds the key to the future of the euro area.,1_93
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,Only with more integration and discipline we can have a really credible euro area.,1_94
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"Honourable members,

These are indeed important steps forward, but we must go further.",1_95
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,We need to complete our monetary union with an economic union.,1_96
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,We need to achieve the tasks of Maastricht.,1_97
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,It was an illusion to think that we could have a common currency and a single market with national approaches to economic and budgetary policy.,1_98
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,Let's avoid another illusion that we can have a common currency and a single market with an intergovernmental approach.,1_99
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"For the euro area to be credible – and this not only the message of the federalists, this is the message of the markets – we need a truly Community approach.",1_100
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"We need to really integrate the euro area, we need to complete the monetary union with real economic union.",1_101
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,And this truly Community approach can be built how?,1_102
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"In the coming weeks, the Commission will build on the six-pack and present a proposal for a single, coherent framework to deepen economic coordination and integration, particularly in the euro area.",1_103
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,This will be done in a way that ensures the compatibility between the euro area and the Union as a whole.,1_104
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,We do not want the euro area to break of course the great acquis of the single market and all our four freedoms.,1_105
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"At the same time, we can pool decision making to enhance our competitiveness.",1_106
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"This could be done by integrating the Euro Plus Pact into this framework, in full respect of the national implementation competences.",1_107
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"For all of this to work, we need more than ever the independent authority of the Commission, to propose and assess the actions that the Member States should take.",1_108
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"Governments, let's be frank, cannot do this by themselves.",1_109
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,Nor can this be done by negotiations between governments.,1_110
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"Indeed, within the Community competences, the Commission is the economic government of the Union, we certainly do not need more institutions for this.",1_111
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,For a reason the Treaties have created supra-national institutions.,1_112
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"For a reason the European Commission, the European Central Bank, the European Court of Justice were created.",1_113
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,The Commission is the guarantor of fairness.,1_114
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"Moreover, the Commission, which naturally works in partnership with the Member States, is voted by and accountable to this House.",1_115
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,The directly elected Parliament both of the euro area and of the European Union as a whole.,1_116
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"Honourable members,

It is also time to have unified external representation of the euro area.",1_117
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,In accordance with the Treaty the Commission will make proposals for this purpose.,1_118
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,A Union of stability and responsibility built on this basis and with common approach will also allow the Member States to seize fully the advantages of a bigger market for the issuance of sovereign debt.,1_119
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"Once the euro area is fully equipped with the instruments necessary to ensure both integration and discipline, the issuance of joint debt will be seen as a natural and advantageous step for all.",1_120
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"On condition that such Eurobonds will be ""Stability Bonds"": bonds that are designed in a way that rewards those who play by the rules, and deters those who don't.",1_121
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"As I already announced to this house, the Commission will present options for such ""Stability Bonds"" in the coming weeks.",1_122
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"Some of these options can be implemented within the current Treaty, whereas fully fledged 'Eurobonds' would require Treaty change.",1_123
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"And this is important because, Honourable Members, we can do a lot within the existing Treaty of Lisbon.",1_124
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"And there is no excuse for not doing it, and for not doing it now.",1_125
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,But it may be necessary to consider further changes to the Treaty.,1_126
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,I am also thinking particularly of the constraint of unanimity.,1_127
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,The pace of our joint endeavour cannot be dictated by the slowest.,1_128
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,And today we have a Union where it is the slowest member that dictates the speed of all the other Member States.,1_129
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"This is not credible also from the markets' point of view, this is why we need to solve this problem of decision making.",1_130
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,A Member State has of course the right not to accept decisions.,1_131
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"That is a question, as they say, of national sovereignty.",1_132
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"But a Member State does not have the right to block the moves of others, the others also have their national sovereignty and if they want to go further, they should go further.",1_133
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,Our willingness to envisage Treaty change should not be a way or an excuse to delay the reforms that are necessary today but I believe that this longer term perspective will reinforce the credibility of our decisions now.,1_134
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,A Union of stability and responsibility means swiftly completing the work on a new system of regulation for the financial sector.,1_135
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"We need well-capitalised, responsible banks lending to the real economy.",1_136
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,Much has been said about the alleged vulnerability of some of our banks.,1_137
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,European banks have substantially strengthened their capital positions over the past year.,1_138
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,They are now raising capital to fill the remaining gaps identified by the stress tests in summer.,1_139
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,This is necessary to limit the damage to financial market turbulence on the real economy and on jobs.,1_140
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"Over the last three years, we have designed a new system of financial regulation.",1_141
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"Let's remember, we have already tabled 29 pieces of legislation.",1_142
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"You have already adopted several of them, including the creation of independent supervising authorities, which are already working.",1_143
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"Now it is important to approve our proposals for new rules on:

    derivatives;

    naked short selling and credit default swaps;

    fair remuneration for bankers.",1_144
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"These propositions are there, they should be adopted by the Council and by the Parliament.",1_145
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"The Commission will deliver the remaining proposals by the end of this year, namely rules on:

    credit rating agencies;

    bank resolution;

    personal responsibility of financial operatives.",1_146
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,So we will be the first constituency in the G20 to have delivered on our commitment to global efforts for financial regulation.,1_147
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"Honourable members,

In the last three years, Member States - I should say taxpayers - have granted aid and provided guarantees of € 4.6 trillion to the financial sector.",1_148
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,It is time for the financial sector to make a contribution back to society.,1_149
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"That is why I am very proud to say that today, the Commission adopted a proposal for the Financial Transaction Tax.",1_150
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,Today I am putting before you a very important text that if implemented may generate a revenue of about € 55 billion per year.,1_151
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"Some people will ask ""Why?"".",1_152
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,Why?,1_153
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,It is a question of fairness.,1_154
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"If our farmers, if our workers, if all the sectors of the economy from industry to agriculture to services, if they all pay a contribution to the society also the banking sector should make a contribution to the society.",1_155
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"And if we need – because we need – fiscal consolidation, if we need more revenues the question is where these revenues are coming from.",1_156
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,Are we going to tax labour more?,1_157
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,Are we going to tax consumption more?,1_158
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,I think it is fair to tax financial activities that in some of our Member States do not pay the proportionate contribution to the society.,1_159
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,It is not only financial institutions who should pay a fair share.,1_160
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,We cannot afford to turn a blind eye to tax evasion.,1_161
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,So it is time to adopt our proposals on savings tax within the European Union.,1_162
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,And I call on the Member States to finally give the Commission the mandate we have asked for to negotiate tax agreements for the whole European Union with third countries.,1_163
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"Honourable members,

Stability and responsibility are not enough on their own.",1_164
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,We need stability but we also need growth.,1_165
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,We need responsibility but we also need solidarity.,1_166
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,The economy can only remain strong if it delivers growth and jobs.,1_167
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"That's why we must unleash the energy of our economy, especially the real economy.",1_168
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,The forecasts today point to a strong slowdown.,1_169
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,But significant growth in Europe is not an impossible dream.,1_170
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,It will not come magically tomorrow.,1_171
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,But we can create the conditions for growth to resume.,1_172
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,We have done it before.,1_173
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,We must and we can do it again.,1_174
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,It is true that we do not have much room for a new fiscal stimulus.,1_175
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,But that does not mean that we cannot do more to promote growth.,1_176
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"First, those who have fiscal space available must explore it – but in a sustainable way.",1_177
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"Second, all member states need to promote structural reforms so that we can increase our competitiveness in the world and promote growth.",1_178
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"Together, we can and must tap the potential of the Single Market, exploit all the benefits of trade and mobilise investment at the Union level.",1_179
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,Let me start with the Single Market.,1_180
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"Full implementation of the Services Directive alone could, according to our estimates, deliver up to € 140 billion in economic gains.",1_181
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"But today, two years after the deadline for implementation, several Member States have still not adopted the necessary laws.",1_182
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,So we are not benefiting from all the possible gains from having a true services liberalisation in Europe.,1_183
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,But we can also do more.,1_184
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,We must adopt what is on the table.,1_185
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,We have adopted the Single Market Act in the European Commission.,1_186
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,A number of key initiatives are ready.,1_187
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,We are close to having a European patent which would cut the cost of protection to 20% of current costs.,1_188
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,I expect this is to be concluded by the end of this year.,1_189
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"Moreover, for the Single Market Act, we should consider a fast track legislative procedure.",1_190
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"By the way, in many areas we should take a fast track legislative procedure because we are living in real emergency times.",1_191
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,This will allow us to respond to these extraordinary circumstances.,1_192
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,And growth in the future will depend more and more on harnessing information technology.,1_193
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"We need a digital single market, which will benefit each and every European by around €1500 per year – by using the possibilities of e-commerce to ending, for instance, mobile roaming charges.",1_194
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,An extra 10 % in broadband penetration would bring us between 1 and 1.5 % of extra annual growth.,1_195
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,In a competitive world we must be also well-educated with skills to face these new challenges.,1_196
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,We must innovate.,1_197
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,And we must act in a sustainable way.,1_198
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"We have already presented detailed proposals on innovation, resource-efficiency and how we can strengthen our industrial base.",1_199
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,Modern industrial policy is about investing in research and innovation.,1_200
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"We need to accelerate the adoption of our efforts to boost the use of venture capital to fund young, innovative companies across Europe.",1_201
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"Sustainable jobs will come if we focus on innovation and new technologies, including green technologies.",1_202
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"We must see that ""green"" and growth go together.",1_203
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"For example, the renewables sector has already created 300,000 jobs in past 5 years in the European Union.",1_204
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,The global green technology market will triple over the next decade.,1_205
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,We must focus our action on where it makes a real impact.,1_206
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"Growth of the future means we must actively pursue also our smart regulation agenda, which will give a saving of € 38 billion for European companies, particularly for SMEs.",1_207
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,But Member States must also do their part in reducing the administrative burden.,1_208
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,But we also need investment.,1_209
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,These reforms are important but we also need some kind of investment at European level.,1_210
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"A Union of growth and solidarity needs modern, interconnected infrastructures.",1_211
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"We have proposed for the next Multi-Annual Financial Framework (MFF) to create a facility to connect Europe – in energy, in transport, in digital.",1_212
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,This innovative part of our MFF proposal has to be seen together with another very important innovative idea: the project bond.,1_213
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,In the coming weeks the Commission will publish its proposals for EU project bonds.,1_214
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"We are also proposing pilot projects, so that we can fund that growth.",1_215
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,We can do it even before the MFF is adopted.,1_216
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,In this way we can frontload some of the major infrastructure investments Europe needs.,1_217
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"The Union and its Member States should urgently consider how to allow our own policy-driven bank, the European Investment Bank to do more – and possibly much more – to finance long-term investment.",1_218
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"To do so, we need to explore ways to reinforce the EIB's resources and capital base so that it can lend to the real economy.",1_219
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"In the year 2000, there was € 22 billion of venture capital in Europe.",1_220
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,In 2010 there was only € 3 billion.,1_221
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,If we want to promote entrepreneurship we must reverse this decline and we need that support namely for SMEs.,1_222
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"We can also get more growth out of the Structural Funds, by increasing absorption capacity, using the Structural Funds to support macroeconomic performance.",1_223
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"They are essential for innovation, for training and employment, and for SMEs.",1_224
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,I would also like to urge this House to adopt by the end of the year the proposals we made in August to increase cofinancing rates to those countries with assistance programmes.,1_225
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"This will inject essential funding into these economies, while reducing pressure on national budgets.",1_226
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"Honourable members,

Reforms to our labour markets, public finances and pension systems require a major effort from all parts of society.",1_227
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"We all know these changes are necessary, so that we can reform our social market economy and keep our social model.",1_228
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"But it is imperative that we hold on to our values – values of fairness, of inclusiveness and of solidarity.",1_229
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,Right now we need to give concrete hope to the 1 in 5 of our young people who cannot find work.,1_230
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"In some countries, the situation of our young people is simply dramatic.",1_231
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,I want to call on companies to make a special effort to provide internships and apprenticeships for young people.,1_232
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,These can be supported by the European Social Fund.,1_233
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"By getting businesses, the social partners, national authorities and the Union level working in a ""Young Opportunities Initiative"", we can make a difference.",1_234
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"This I believe is the most urgent social matter to respond to the anxiety of our young people that cannot find a job and it is much better to have an apprenticeship, a traineeship, than to be with that anxiety in the streets expressing that lack of confidence in the Union as a whole.",1_235
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"We must accelerate the most urgent parts of our Growth and Jobs Plan, Europe 2020.",1_236
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,The Commission will focus on the situation of young people in each and every Member State in its Country-specific recommendations for next year.,1_237
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,I believe we must give our future a real chance.,1_238
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,Right now we also need to act to help the 80 million Europeans at risk of poverty.,1_239
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,This means that the Council must finally approve our proposal to safeguard the programme for the supply of food for the most deprived persons.,1_240
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,I would like to thank this Parliament for the political support it has given to our proposed solution.,1_241

Fifty years ago, 12 countries in Europe came together to sign the Social Charter.",1_242
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,It was exactly in October 50 years ago.,1_243
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"Today, that Charter has 47 signatories, including all our Member States.",1_244
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"To guarantee these fundamental values in Europe, I believe we need to boost the quality of social dialogue at European level.",1_245
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"The renewal of Europe can only succeed with the input and the ownership of all the social partners – of trade unions, of workers, of businesses, civil society in general.",1_246
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,We should remember that our Europe is a Europe of citizens.,1_247
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"As citizens, we all gain through Europe.",1_248
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,We gain a European identity and citizenship apart from our national citizenship.,1_249
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,European citizenship adds a set of rights and opportunities.,1_250
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,"The opportunity to freely cross borders, to study and work abroad.",1_251

1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,Just as the Commission is doing now with our proposals on Schengen.,1_253
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,We will not tolerate a rolling back of our citizens' rights.,1_254
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,We will defend the freedom of circulation and all the freedoms in our Union.,1_255

The Commission's activities, as you well know, cover many other fields.",1_256

1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,Today it is fashionable to talk of a G2.,1_261
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,I believe the world does not want a G2.,1_262
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,It is not in the interests of the Two themselves.,1_263
1,2011-09-28,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_11_607,We know the tension that bipolarity created during the Cold War.,1_264

2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,Because inequality is not sustainable.,2_141

2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,That is why we must strengthen social cohesion.,2_144
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,It is a feature that distinguishes European society from alternative models.,2_145

2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,But an effective social protection system that helps those in need is not an obstacle to prosperity.,2_149
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,It is indeed an indispensable element of it.,2_150

2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,Stopping tax fraud and tax evasion could put extra billions into the public purse across Europe.,2_156
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,"This is why the Commission will fight for an agreement on the revised savings tax directive, and on mandates to negotiate stronger savings tax agreements with third countries.",2_157
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,Their completion would be a major source of legitimate tax revenues.,2_158
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,"And the Commission will continue to fight for a fair and ambitious Financial Transactions Tax that would ensure that taxpayers benefit from the financial sector, not just that the financial sector benefits from taxpayers.",2_159

2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,And fairness is an essential condition to make the necessary economic reforms socially and politically acceptable.,2_162

2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,"But when monetary policy channels are not working properly, the Commission believes that it is within the mandate of the ECB to take the necessary actions, for instance in the secondary markets of sovereign debt.",2_180
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,"Indeed, the ECB has not only the right but also the duty to restore the integrity of monetary policy.",2_181

2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,But it is not sufficient.,2_186
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,We must go further.,2_187
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,We must complete the economic and monetary union.,2_188
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,We must create a banking union and a fiscal union and the corresponding institutional and political mechanisms.,2_189
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,"Today, the Commission is presenting legislative proposals for a single European supervisory mechanism.",2_190
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,This is the stepping stone to a banking union.,2_191
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,"The crisis has shown that while banks became transnational, rules and oversight remained national.",2_192
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,"And when things went wrong, it was the taxpayers who had to pick up the bill.",2_193
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,"Over the past four years the EU has overhauled the rulebook for banks, leading the world in implementing the G20 commitments.",2_194
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,"But mere coordination is no longer adequate – we need to move to common supervisory decisions, namely within the Euro area.",2_195
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,"The single supervisory mechanism proposed today will create a reinforced architecture, with a core role for the European Central Bank, and appropriate articulation with the European Banking Authority, which will restore confidence in the supervision of the banks in the Euro area.",2_196
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,It will be a supervision for all Euro area banks.,2_197
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,"Supervision must be able to look everywhere because systemic risks can be anywhere, not just in so-called systemically relevant banks.",2_198
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,"Of course, this in a system that fully engages the national supervisors.",2_199
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,"The package comprises two legal texts, one on the ECB and the other on the EBA, which go together.",2_200
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,"It is clear that this parliament will have a crucial role to play in the adoption of the new mechanism, and after that in its democratic oversight.",2_201
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,This is a crucial first step towards the banking union I proposed before this House in June.,2_202
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,"Getting the European supervisor in place is the top priority for now, because it is the precondition for the better management of banking crises, from banking resolution to deposit insurance.",2_203
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,"In parallel the Commission will continue to work on the reform of the banking sector, to make sure it plays its role in the responsible financing of the real economy.",2_204
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,That means improving long term financing for SMEs and other companies.,2_205
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,"It means rules on reference indices, so we do not again see the manipulation of bank interest rates affecting companies and mortgage holders alike.",2_206
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,It means legislation to ensure that banks give a fair deal to consumers and another look at the structure of banking activities to eliminate inherent risks.,2_207
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,"In all of this, the role of this Parliament is essential.",2_208
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,The Commission endeavours to work in close partnership with you.,2_209
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,But there is a second element of a deeper economic union it is the move towards a fiscal union.,2_210
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,The case for it is clear: the economic decisions of one Member State impact the others.,2_211
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,So we need stronger economic policy co-ordination.,2_212
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,"We need a stronger and more binding framework for the national decision making for key economic policies, as the only way to prevent imbalances.",2_213
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,"While much has been done here, for instance through the six-pack and the Country-Specific Recommendations, further steps are crucial to combine specific conditions with specific incentives and to really make the economic and monetary union sustainable.",2_214
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,"To deliver lasting results, we need to develop a fully equipped Community economic governance together with a genuine, credible Community fiscal capacity.",2_215
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,We do not need to separate institutions or to create new institutions for that.,2_216
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,"Quite the contrary: for this to be effective and quick, the best way is to work with and through the existing institutions: The European Commission as the independent European authority, and overseen by the European Parliament as the parliamentary representation at the European level.",2_217
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,"And it is in such a framework that over time, steps for genuine mutualisation of debt redemption and debt issuance can take their place.",2_218
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,So economic reform coupled with a genuine economic and monetary union: these are the engines to get our boat moving forward.,2_219
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,The Commission will publish a blueprint for deepening the economic and monetary union still this autumn.,2_220
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,This blueprint will be presented to this House.,2_221
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,"Because these questions must be discussed with and by the representatives of the people

At the same time, it will inform the debate at the December European Council that will be prepared by the report that the President of the European Council, myself and the Presidents of the European Central Bank and the Eurogroup have been asked to present.",2_222
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,"Our blueprint will identify the tools and instruments, and present options for legal drafting that would give effect to them, from policy coordination to fiscal capacity to debt redemption.",2_223
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,"And, where necessary – as in the case of jointly and severally guaranteed public debt – it would identify the treaty changes necessary, because some of these changes require modifications to the Treaty.",2_224
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,"It will present a blue-print for what we need to accomplish not only in the next few weeks and months, but in the next years.",2_225

Honourable Members,

b) Political union:

Ultimately, the credibility and sustainability of the Economic and Monetary Union depends on the institutions and the political construct behind it.",2_226
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,This is why the Economic and Monetary Union raises the question of a political union and the European democracy that must underpin it.,2_227
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,"If we want economic and monetary union to succeed, we need to combine ambition and proper sequencing.",2_228

2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,We cannot continue trying to solve European problems just with national solutions.,2_231
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,This debate has to take place in our societies and among our citizens.,2_232
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,"But, today, I would like to make an appeal also to European thinkers.",2_233
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,"To men and women of culture, to join this debate on the future of Europe.",2_234
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,And I make this appeal to you.,2_235
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,This is the house of European democracy.,2_236
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,We must strengthen the role of the European Parliament at the European level.,2_237
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,And we need to promote a genuine complementarity and cooperation between the European and national parliaments.,2_238
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,This also cannot be done without strengthening European political parties.,2_239
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,"Indeed, we have very often a real disconnect between political parties in the capitals and the European political parties here in Strasbourg.",2_240
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,This is why we have to recognise the political debate is cast all too often as if it were just between national parties.,2_241
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,"Even in the European elections we do not see the name of the European political parties on the ballot box, we see a national debate between national political parties.",2_242
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,This is why we need a reinforced statute for European political parties.,2_243
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,I am proud to announce that the Commission has adopted a proposal for this today.,2_244
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,An important means to deepen the pan-European political debate would be the presentation by European political parties of their candidate for the post of Commission President at the European Parliament elections already in 2014.,2_245
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,This can be done without Treaty change.,2_246
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,This would be a decisive step to make the possibility of a European choice offered by these elections even clearer.,2_247
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,I call on the political parties to commit to this step and thus to further Europeanise these European elections.,2_248

Honourable Members,

2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,In recent months we have seen threats to the legal and democratic fabric in some of our European states.,2_254
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,The European Parliament and the Commission were the first to raise the alarm and played the decisive role in seeing these worrying developments brought into check.,2_255
2,2012-09-12,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_12_596,But these situations also revealed limits of our institutional arrangements.,2_256

3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,It is the way to remedy one of the most alarming and unacceptable results of the crisis: increased fragmentation of Europe's financial sector and credit markets - even an implicit re-nationalisation.,3_88

3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,Isn't it a paradox that we have an internal market for goods but when it comes to digital market we have 28 national markets?,3_108
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,How can we grab all the opportunities of the future that are opened by the digital economy if we don't conclude this internal market?,3_109
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,The same logic applies to the broader digital agenda: it solves real problems and improves daily life for citizens.,3_110

3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,"So we have mapped out, in the Commission Blueprint for a deep and genuine Economic and Monetary Union, not only the economic and monetary features, but also the necessities, possibilities and limits of deepening our institutional set-up in the medium and long term.",3_258
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,"The Commission will continue to work for the implementation of its Blueprint, step by step, one phase after the other.",3_259
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,"And I confirm, as announced last year, the intention to present, before the European elections, further ideas on the future of our Union and how best to consolidate and deepen the community method and community approach in the longer term.",3_260
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,"That way, they can be subject to a real European debate.",3_261
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,They will set out the principles and orientations that are necessary for a true political union.,3_262
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,"Honourable Members,

We can only meet the challenges of our time if we strengthen the consensus on fundamental objectives.",3_263
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,"Politically, we must not be divided by differences between the euro area and those outside it, between the centre and the periphery, between the North and the South, between East and West.",3_264
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,"The European Union must remain a project for all members, a community of equals.",3_265
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,"Economically, Europe has always been a way to close gaps between countries, regions and people.",3_266
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,And that must remain so.,3_267
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,We cannot do member states' work for them.,3_268
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,The responsibility remains theirs.,3_269
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,But we can and must complement it with European responsibility and European solidarity.,3_270
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,"For that reason, strengthening the social dimension is a priority for the months to come, together with our social partners.",3_271
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,The Commission will come with its communication on the social dimension of the economic and monetary union on the 2nd of October.,3_272
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,"Solidarity is a key element of what being part of Europe is all about, and something to take pride in.",3_273
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,"Safeguarding its values, such as the rule of law, is what the European Union was made to do, from its inception to the latest chapters in enlargement.",3_274
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,"In last year's State of the Union speech, at a moment of challenges to the rule of law in our own member states, I addressed the need to make a bridge between political persuasion and targeted infringement procedures on the one hand, and what I call the nuclear option of Article 7 of the Treaty, namely suspension of a member states' rights.",3_275
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,Experience has confirmed the usefulness of the Commission role as an independent and objective referee.,3_276
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,We should consolidate this experience through a more general framework.,3_277
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,"It should be based on the principle of equality between member states, activated only in situations where there is a serious, systemic risk to the rule of law, and triggered by pre-defined benchmarks.",3_278
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,The Commission will come forward with a communication on this.,3_279
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,I believe it is a debate that is key to our idea of Europe.,3_280
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,This does not mean that national sovereignty or democracy are constrained.,3_281
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,But we do need a robust European mechanism to influence the equation when basic common principles are at stake.,3_282
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,There are certain non-negotiable values that the EU and its member states must and shall always defend.,3_283
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,"Honourable Members,

The polarisation that resulted from the crisis poses a risk to us all, to the project, to the European project.",3_284
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,"We, legitimate political representatives of the European Union, can turn the tide.",3_285
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,"You, the democratic representatives of Europe, directly elected, will be at the forefront of the political debate.",3_286
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,The question I want to pose is: which picture of Europe will voters be presented with?,3_287
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,"The candid version, or the cartoon version?",3_288
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,The myths or the facts?,3_289
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,"The honest, reasonable version, or the extremist, populist version?",3_290
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,It's an important difference.,3_291
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,I know some people out there will say Europe is to blame for the crisis and the hardship.,3_292
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,But we can remind people that Europe was not at the origin of this crisis.,3_293
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,It resulted from mismanagement of public finances by national governments and irresponsible behaviour in financial markets.,3_294
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,We can explain how Europe has worked to fix the crisis.,3_295
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,"What we would have lost if we hadn't succeeded in upholding the single market, because it was under threat, and the common currency, because some people predicted the end of the euro.",3_296
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,If we hadn't coordinated recovery efforts and employment initiatives.,3_297
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,Some people will say that Europe is forcing governments to cut spending.,3_298
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,"But we can remind voters that government debt got way out of hand even before the crisis, not because of but despite Europe.",3_299
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,"We can add that the most vulnerable in our societies, and our children, would end up paying the price if we don't persevere now.",3_300
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,"And the truth is that countries inside the euro or outside the euro, in Europe or outside Europe, they are making efforts to curb their very burdened public finances.",3_301
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,Some will campaign saying that we have given too much money to vulnerable countries.,3_302
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,Others will say we have given too little money to vulnerable countries.,3_303
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,"But every one of us can explain what we did and why: there is a direct link between one country's loans and another country's banks, between one country's investments and another country's businesses, between one country's workers and another country's companies.",3_304
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,This kind of interdependence means only European solutions work.,3_305
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,"What I tell people is: when you are in the same boat, one cannot say: 'your end of the boat is sinking.'",3_306
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,"We were in the same boat when things went well, and we are in it together when things are difficult.",3_307
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,Some people might campaign saying: Europe has grabbed too much power.,3_308
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,"Others will claim Europe always does too little, too late.",3_309
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,The interesting things is that sometimes we have the same people saying that Europe is not doing enough and at the same time that's not giving more means to Europe to do what Europe has to do.,3_310
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,But we can explain that member states have entrusted Europe with tasks and competences.,3_311
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,The European Union is not a foreign power.,3_312
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,It is the result of democratic decisions by the European institutions and by member states.,3_313
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,"At the same time we must acknowledge that, in some areas, Europe still lacks the power to do what is asked of it.",3_314
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,"A fact that is all too easily forgotten by those, and there are many out there, who always like to nationalise success and Europeanise failure.",3_315
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,"Ultimately, what we have, and what we don't have, is the result of democratic decision-making.",3_316
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,And I think we should remind people of that.,3_317
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,"Ladies and gentlemen,

Mr President,

Honourable members,

I hope the European Parliament will take up this challenge with all the idealism it holds, with as much realism and determination as the times demand of us.",3_318
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,The arguments are there.,3_319
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,The facts are there.,3_320
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,The agenda has been set out.,3_321
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,"In 8 months' time, voters will decide.",3_322
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,"Now, it's up to us to make the case for Europe.",3_323
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,We can do so by using the next 8 months to conclude as much as we can.,3_324
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,We have a lot to do still.,3_325
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,"Adopt and implement the European budget, the MFF.",3_326
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,This is critical for investment in our regions all over Europe.,3_327
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,"This is indispensable for the first priority we have: to fight against unemployment, notably youth unemployment.",3_328
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,Advance and implement the banking union.,3_329
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,This is critical to address the problem of financing for businesses and SMEs.,3_330
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,These are our clear priorities: employment and growth.,3_331
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,Our job is not finished.,3_332
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,It is in its decisive phase.,3_333
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,"Because, Honourable Members, the elections will not only be about the European Parliament, nor will they be about the European Commission or about the Council or about this or that personality.",3_334
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,They will be about Europe.,3_335
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,We will be judged together.,3_336
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,So let us work together - for Europe.,3_337
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,With passion and with determination.,3_338
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,Let us not forget: one hundred years ago –Europe was sleepwalking into the catastrophy of the war of 1914.,3_339
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,"Next year, in 2014, I hope Europe will be walking out of the crisis towards a Europe that is more united, stronger and open.",3_340
3,2013-09-11,Barroso,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_13_684,Thank you for your attention.,3_341
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,"Mr President,

Honourable Members of the European Parliament,

Today is the first time during my mandate as President of the European Commission that I have the honour to address this House on the State of our European Union.",4_0
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,I would therefore like to recall the political importance of this very special institutional moment.,4_1
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,The State of the Union address is foreseen explicitly by the Framework Agreement that governs the relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission.,4_2
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,"This Agreement provides that “[e]ach year in the first part-session of September, a State of the Union debate will be held in which the President of the Commission shall deliver an address, taking stock of the current year and looking ahead to priorities for the following years.",4_3
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,"To that end, the President of the Commission will in parallel set out in writing to Parliament the main elements guiding the preparation of the Commission Work Programme for the following year.”

The State of the Union address requires the President of the Commission to take stock of the current situation of our European Union and to set priorities for the work ahead.",4_4
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,And it launches the interinstitutional process leading to a new Work Programme of the European Commission for the year ahead.,4_5
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,"Together with Frans Timmermans, my First Vice-President, this morning I sent a letter to the Presidents of both branches of the European legislator: to President Martin Schulz, and to Luxembourg’s Prime Minister Xavier Bettel, who currently holds the rotating Presidency of the Council.",4_6
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,"This letter sets out in detail the numerous actions the Commission intends to take by means of legislation and other initiatives, from now until the end of 2016.",4_7
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,"We are proposing an ambitious, focused, and intense legislative agenda that will require Commission, Parliament and Council to work closely and effectively together.",4_8
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,I will not go into the details of our legislative agenda now.,4_9
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,We will have a structured dialogue with the Parliament and the Council on this in the weeks to come.,4_10
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,But I feel that today is not the moment to speak about all this.,4_11
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,I am the first President of the Commission whose nomination and election is the direct result of the outcome of the European Parliament elections in May 2014.,4_12
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,"Having campaigned as a lead candidate, as Spitzenkandidat, in the run up to the elections, I had the opportunity to be a more political President.",4_13
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,"This political role is foreseen by the Treaties, by means of which the Member States made the Commission the promoter of the general interest of the Union.",4_14
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,But the crisis years have diminished this understanding.,4_15
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,This is why I said last September before this House that I wanted to lead a political Commission.,4_16
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,A very political Commission.,4_17
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,I said this not because I believe we can and should politicise everything.,4_18
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,"I said it because I believe the immense challenges Europe is currently facing – both internally and externally – leave us no choice but to address them from a very political perspective, in a very political manner and having the political consequences of our decisions very much in mind.",4_19
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,Recent events have confirmed the urgent need for such a political approach in the European Union.,4_20
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,This is not the time for business as usual.,4_21
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,This is not the time for ticking off lists or checking whether this or that sectorial initiative has found its way into the State of the Union speech.,4_22
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,"This is not the time to count how many times the word social, economic or sustainable appears in the State of the Union speech.",4_23

4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,This list will enable Member States to fast track asylum procedures for nationals of countries that are presumed safe to live in.,4_135
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,"This presumption of safety must in our view certainly apply to all countries which the European Council unanimously decided meet the basic Copenhagen criteria for EU membership – notably as regards democracy, the rule of law, and fundamental rights.",4_136
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,"It should also apply to the other potential candidate countries on the Western Balkans, in view of their progress made towards candidate status.",4_137
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,I am of course aware that the list of safe countries is only a procedural simplification.,4_138
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,"It cannot take away the fundamental right of asylum for asylum seekers from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Kosovo, Montenegro, Serbia, and Turkey.",4_139
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,"But it allows national authorities to focus on those refugees which are much more likely to be granted asylum, notably those from Syria.",4_140
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,And this focus is very much needed in the current situation.,4_141
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,"I also believe that beyond the immediate action needed to address current emergencies, it is time we prepare a more fundamental change in the way we deal with asylum applications – and notably the Dublin system that requires that asylum applications be dealt with by the first country of entry.",4_142
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,We need more Europe in our asylum policy.,4_143
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,We need more Union in our refugee policy.,4_144
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,A true European refugee and asylum policy requires solidarity to be permanently anchored in our policy approach and our rules.,4_145
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,"This is why, today, the Commission is also proposing a permanent relocation mechanism, which will allow us to deal with crisis situations more swiftly in the future.",4_146
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,A common refugee and asylum policy requires further approximation of asylum policies after refugee status is granted.,4_147
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,"Member States need to take a second look at their support, integration and inclusion policies.",4_148
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,The Commission is ready to look into how EU Funds can support these efforts.,4_149
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,And I am strongly in favour of allowing asylum seekers to work and earn their own money whilst their applications are being processed.,4_150
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,A united refugee and asylum policy also requires stronger joint efforts to secure our external borders.,4_151
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,"Fortunately, we have given up border controls between the Member States of the Schengen area, to guarantee free movement of people, a unique symbol of European integration.",4_152
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,But the other side of the coin to free movement is that we must work together more closely to manage our external borders.,4_153
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,This is what our citizens expect.,4_154
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,"The Commission said it back in May, and I said it during my election campaign: We need to strengthen Frontex significantly and develop it into a fully operational European border and coast guard system.",4_155
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,It is certainly feasible.,4_156
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,But it will cost money.,4_157
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,The Commission believes this is money well invested.,4_158
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,This is why we will propose ambitious steps towards a European Border and Coast Guard before the end of the year.,4_159
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,"A truly united, European migration policy also means that we need to look into opening legal channels for migration.",4_160
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,Let us be clear: this will not help in addressing the current refugee crisis.,4_161
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,"But if there are more, safe and controlled roads opened to Europe, we can manage migration better and make the illegal work of human traffickers less attractive.",4_162

4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,We all saw what happened in Greece during the summer: Citizens were – understandably – taking out their savings since they had little trust and confidence in the financial capability of the State to support its banking system.,4_311
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,This must change.,4_312

4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,This will be reflected in our proposals to streamline and strengthen the European Semester of economic policy coordination further.,4_334

4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,I agree with them that there is something wrong in a market when the price of a litre of milk is less than the price of a litre of water.,4_482
4,2015-09-11,Juncker,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_5614,But I do not believe that we can or should start micromanaging the milk market from Brussels.,4_483

9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,But there is simply no security and defence issue where less cooperation is the answer.,9_250
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,We need to invest in our joint partnership and to draw on each side's unique strength.,9_251
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,This is why we are working with Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on a new EU-NATO Joint Declaration to be presented before the end of the year.,9_252
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,But this is only one part of the equation.,9_253
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,Europe can – and clearly should – be able and willing to do more on its own.,9_254
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,"But if we are to do more, we first need to explain why.",9_255
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,I see three broad categories.,9_256
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,"First, we need to provide stability in our neighbourhood and across different regions.",9_257
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,"We are connected to the world by narrow straits, stormy seas and vast land borders.",9_258
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,"Because of that geography, Europe knows better than anyone that if you don't deal in time with the crisis abroad, the crisis comes to you.",9_259
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,"Secondly, the nature of the threats we face is evolving rapidly: from hybrid or cyber-attacks to the growing arms race in space.",9_260
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,Disruptive technology has been a great equaliser in the way power can be used today by rogue states or non-state groups.,9_261
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,You no longer need armies and missiles to cause mass damage.,9_262
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,"You can paralyse industrial plants, city administrations and hospitals – all you need is your laptop.",9_263
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,You can disrupt entire elections with a smartphone and an internet connection.,9_264
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,The third reason is that the European Union is a unique security provider.,9_265
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,"There will be missions where NATO or the UN will not be present, but where the EU should be.",9_266

9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,"We can combine military and civilian, along with diplomacy and development – and we have a long history in building and protecting peace.",9_268
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,"The good news is that over the past years, we have started to develop a European defence ecosystem.",9_269
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,But what we need is the European Defence Union.,9_270

9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,On what type and how many we need: battlegroups or EU entry forces.,9_272
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,This is no doubt part of the debate – and I believe it will be part of the solution.,9_273
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,But the more fundamental issue is why this has not worked in the past.,9_274
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,You can have the most advanced forces in the world – but if you are never prepared to use them - of what use are they?,9_275
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,What has held us back until now is not just a shortfall of capacity – it is the lack of political will.,9_276
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,"And if we develop this political will, there is a lot that we can do at EU level.",9_277
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,"Allow me to give you three concrete examples:

First, we need to build the foundation for collective decision-making – this is what I call situational awareness.",9_278
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,"We fall short if Member States active in the same region, do not share their information on the European level.",9_279
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,It is vital that we improve intelligence cooperation.,9_280
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,But this is not just about intelligence in the narrow sense.,9_281
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,It is about bringing together the knowledge from all services and all sources.,9_282

9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,Their work gives us a unique scope and depth of knowledge.,9_284
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,It is out there!,9_285
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,"But we can only use that, to make informed decisions if we have the full picture.",9_286
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,And this is currently not the case.,9_287

9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,Information is fragmented.,9_289
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,This is why the EU could consider its own Joint Situational Awareness Centre to fuse all the different pieces of information.,9_290
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,"And to be better prepared, to be fully informed and to be able to decide.",9_291
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,"Secondly, we need to improve interoperability.",9_292
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,"This is why we are already investing in common European platforms, from fighter jets, to drones and cyber.",9_293
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,But we have to keep thinking of new ways to use all possible synergies.,9_294
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,One example could be to consider waiving VAT when buying defence equipment developed and produced in Europe.,9_295
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,"This would not only increase our interoperability, but also decrease our dependencies of today.",9_296
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,"Third, we cannot talk about defence without talking about cyber.",9_297
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,"If everything is connected, everything can be hacked.",9_298
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,"Given that resources are scarce, we have to bundle our forces.",9_299
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,"And we should not just be satisfied to address the cyber threat, but also strive to become a leader in cyber security.",9_300
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,It should be here in Europe where cyber defence tools are developed.,9_301
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,"This is why we need a European Cyber Defence Policy, including legislation on common standards under a new European Cyber Resilience Act.",9_302
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,"So, we can do a lot at EU level.",9_303
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,But Member States need to do more too.,9_304
9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,This starts with a common assessment of the threats we face and a common approach to dealing with them.,9_305

9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,And we need to decide how we can use all of the possibilities that are already in the Treaty.,9_307

9,2021-09-15,Leyen,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701,The same is true of our neighbours in the Western Balkans.,9_316
